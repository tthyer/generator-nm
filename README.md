# generator-nm
Another yeoman generator based on generator-nm. 

* [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) for testing
* [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) for code coverage
* a few basic [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) tasks
* includes an .eslintrc for linting and style checks but assumes [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) is installed globally (if not, `npm i eslint -g` will solve that problem)
